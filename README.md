##Technical Approach

Informatix Inc. is a minority-owned, Sacramento-based technology company that has provided information technology solutions
and services to government and private industry for 30 years. Our response team for the Pre-Qualified Vendor Pool for
Digital Services – Agile Development RFI utilized an agile human centered approach to create our ADPQ prototype. We focused 
on the needs of the end users which drove our feature development and our application program interfaces (API) integration.
We started with a discovery that included surveys, research, and interviews and focus groups with users which was conducted  continuously throughout the iterations. This continuous feedback promoted end user adoption and satisfaction. 

Our team used the following user centric processes to complete this prototype:
* Conducted [surveys]() of the home page immediately following the start of the project
* Conducted research to understand the trends within the industry and other State solutions
* Created [personas]() to identify, personalize and focus on end users’ needs
* Developed [user stories]() and created backlog
* Developed front end UI web/mobile application. Conducted [usability testing]() and improvements were incorporated into
the design and user stories.  The first usability test results are [here.]()
* Developed functioning UI web/mobile application. Conducted [quantitative and qualitative usability testing]() and improvements were incorporated into the user stories and final design
* Developed fully functioning prototype including backend API. Conducted quantitative and qualitative usability testing and prioritized improvements which were incorporated into the user stories, final design or identified as additional improvements if prototype future improvements
